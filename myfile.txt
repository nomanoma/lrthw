    Try entering a word that is not in either of the lines so you can see that Regetron prints nothing. Like "pizza". Doesn't matter what it is.
    Give regetron a file of text with regetron myfile.txt and then try these same expressions to see what you get. Make sure you do not enter the first !data command.
    Do the same thing with the !load command.
    Flip "match" mode on with !match and try these expressions again. Can you explain what's going on?
    If you know Python, go read Regetron's code. It's pretty small.
